I am going to create a Calculator as this project using all that I have learnt about HTML, CSS and JavaScript up to this point.

FIRST - My Calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators that you find on calculators. I first need to create functions for ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY & DIVIDE

SECOND - A Calculator operation consists of a number, an operator, and another number. I need to create 3 variables for each of the parts of a calculator operation. A variable for the first number, the operator, and the second number.

THIRD - I then need to create a new function "operate" that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.

FOURTH - Now I need to create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an "Equals" key. I also need a display for the calculator as well and a clear button to reset it.
